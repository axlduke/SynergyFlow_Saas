SynergyFlow: The AI-Powered Hub for Project SuccessSynergyFlow is a comprehensive, full-stack SaaS application designed to automate workflows, sync teams, and deliver projects faster through intelligent task management, collaboration, and insightful analytics.This project is built using the MERN Stack (MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js).🚀 FeaturesSynergyFlow is structured as a multi-page application, split into public Marketing pages and secure Application pages:Marketing Pages (Public Access)Home Page (/): The main landing page, featuring a hero section, feature summaries, and key Call-to-Actions (CTAs).Features Page (/features): Detailed breakdown of AI, collaboration, and security features.Pricing Page (/pricing): Tiered subscription plans (Starter, Pro, Enterprise) with an FAQ section.About Us Page (/about): Information on the team, mission, and company values.Application Pages (Secure Access)Sign Up/Login (/auth): Secure user authentication and registration flows.Dashboard (/app/dashboard): The user's main landing area, offering an overview of tasks, project activity, and quick stats.Project Manager (/app/projects/:id): The core application view, including the project timeline, task lists, and detailed analytics charts.🛠 Technology StackFrontendReact: Functional components and Hooks.Tailwind CSS: For rapid, responsive, utility-first styling.React Router DOM: For client-side routing.Axios: For API communication.Backend & DatabaseNode.js & Express.js: The RESTful API server.MongoDB & Mongoose: The data persistence layer and object data modeling.JWT (JSON Web Tokens): For stateless, secure authentication.Bcrypt: For secure password hashing.⚙️ PrerequisitesBefore you begin, ensure you have the following installed on your machine:Node.js (v18+) and npm or YarnMongoDB (running locally or a free cluster via MongoDB Atlas)📝 Installation GuideClone the repository and follow the setup instructions for both the server and client.Step 1: Clone and Install Dependencies# Clone the repository
git clone [YOUR_REPO_URL] synergyflow-mern
cd synergyflow-mern

# Install server dependencies
cd server
npm install

# Install client dependencies
cd ../client
npm install
Step 2: Configure Environment Variables (.env)You need a separate .env file in the /server directory.# /server/.env content

# MongoDB Connection String
MONGO_URI=mongodb+srv://<user>:<password>@<cluster-name>/synergyflow?retryWrites=true&w=majority

# Secret key for JWT signing (MAKE THIS COMPLEX!)
JWT_SECRET=YOUR_VERY_STRONG_SECRET_KEY

# Port for the Express server
PORT=5000 
Step 3: Run the ApplicationFrom the root project directory:# In the first terminal, start the server
cd server
npm start

# In the second terminal, start the client (React app)
cd ../client
npm start
The application should now be running! The React app typically starts on http://localhost:3000.🔐 Security HighlightsPassword Hashing: All user passwords are saved using Bcrypt hashing.Authentication: JWT (JSON Web Tokens) are used to secure all application routes.Authorization: The API includes middleware checks to ensure users can only access or modify data belonging to their projects or account.Input Validation: Data is strictly validated using Mongoose Schemas to prevent injection attacks and ensure data integrity.📂 Project Structure ReferenceThe architecture is strictly separated into frontend and backend layers:/synergyflow-mern
